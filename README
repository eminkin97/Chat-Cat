Send Requests to contact each other. History stored in Network Chat Server. 

Two options for client:

B) Send Chat Request. Enter IP Address

Improvements to be done progressively such as, eventually, an actual UI

Chat messages to server to be sent as chat:(name of user chatting):(msg itself)

Chat messages back to client are in the form c:(name of user who is sending the chat):(msg itself)
